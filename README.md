# Thread-Exercises---3

2 solutions has been made for this program. The "wrong" one can be found in the ex20 package. It works but it doesnt do what the assignment asks for.

the right solution is in the package "answer" where callable and future has been used.

The program took around 7 seconds when only running on one thread. When multiple threads are used it only takes as long as the slowest website allows.
